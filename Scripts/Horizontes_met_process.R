## Most water used by woody plants comes in forested settings comes from the top soil layers
## Therefore, we are only intrested in SWP from the top layers
## However, between sites, the layers for which data are available are different
## Therefore, we will consider only the 15 cm depth, which gives a reasonable approximation of the soil water available for the shallow soil profile avialble to plant roots

# Keep only 15 cm depth
